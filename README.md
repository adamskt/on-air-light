# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Why?

Because everyone I know is currently working from home, we need a way to tell our families when we can 
and can't be interrupted. Since that generally lines up with my MS Teams presence information, I decided 
to see if I could bridge the gap between Microsoft Graph and the Hubitat Maker API with an Azure Function.

## 1.2 What?

This is an Azure Function that polls MS Teams presence information for one's AAD account and then tells 
a cloud-enabled Hubitat Elevation device to change the color of a IoT RGB light bulb.
